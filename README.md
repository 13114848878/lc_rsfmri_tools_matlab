- "**network\_construction**" is used to construct the dynamic and static networks, kmeans clustering and obtain each subject's median network of each state.

- "**stat**" is used to statistical analysis, such as ANCOVA, post-hoc two-sample t- test, and get shared(common) and distinct(specific) dysconnectivity across these 3 disorders.

- "**plot**" is used to plot figures for showing the results.

- "**validation**" is used to validation our results.
